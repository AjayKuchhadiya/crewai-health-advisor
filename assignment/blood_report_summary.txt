The blood test report includes the following parameters:
- Hemoglobin levels: 14.5 g/dL (within normal range, which is typically between 13.5 - 17.5 g/dL for men and 12.0 - 15.5 g/dL for women)
- White blood cell count: 6,500 cells/µL (within normal range, which is typically between 4,500 - 11,000 cells/µL)
- Platelet count: 250,000 platelets/µL (within normal range, which is typically between 150,000 - 450,000 platelets/µL)
- Cholesterol levels:
  - Total cholesterol: 190 mg/dL (borderline high, ideal levels are below 200 mg/dL)
  - LDL cholesterol: 110 mg/dL (optimal, ideal levels are below 100 mg/dL)
  - HDL cholesterol: 60 mg/dL (optimal, ideal levels are above 40 mg/dL for men and above 50 mg/dL for women)
  - Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL (borderline high, ideal levels are below 150 mg/dL)

These results suggest that the individual has normal hemoglobin, white blood cell, and platelet counts. However, the total cholesterol and triglycerides levels are slightly elevated, which may indicate an increased risk for heart disease. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and recommendations.
